# Problem one.

Maria is taking statistics and she is confused about the concept of mean square between and mean square within. She goes to the TA and asks for clarification. This is how the TA answers.

First I am going to clarify these concepts by giving you an example of an observational study.

+ In a company they want to compare the attitudes of technical and the administrative staff toward a new health plan. They give a survey of ten questions to 50 engineers and 50 administrative employees. They calculate the mean and standard deviation of each group.

+ From a conceptual point of view within part reflects the differences between the attitudes of engineers and administrators toward the new health plan. While, the between part reflects the differences that exist among the 50 engineers and the 50 administrators toward the new health plan.

+ From a mathematical point of view you need to subtract the mean of the two groups and divide by the square root of the variances of the two groups. This will give you the F-value and then you estimate the p-value using R.

Question to be answered

If you were looking for a TA would you hire this person, Yes or no, and why? Back up your reasoning with…

+ Drawing the right schematic.
+ Showing the relevant formulas.
+ Connecting your conceptual explanation to the formulas you used.

# Problem two.  
Using Houston real estate data posted in the homework folder on week three, answer the following questions.


```{r}
library(readr)
houstonrealesate <- read_csv("Desktop/STATS 402/houstonrealesate.csv")
```

a) Draw the histogram of home prices (Y)

```{r}
hist(houstonrealesate$Yi)
# We can see that the home prices are right skewed. 
```

b) Conduct transformation using the package in library “car” – see lecture two – and decide which transformation if any help to solve the problem.

```{r}
library(car)
symbox(~Yi,data=houstonrealesate)
# The log transformation of the price does the best job of making the distribution symmetric.
```

c) Make the transformation that you think is best and draw the resulting histogram.

```{r}
hist(log(houstonrealesate$Yi))
```


d) Watch the following videos to learn about “boxcox” transformation and use the following commands to calculate the exact value of lambda needed for making the boxcox transformation. After you made the transformation draw the histogram.

```{r}
install.packages("forecast")
library(forecast)
lambda <- BoxCox.lambda(houstonrealesate$Yi)
lambda # -0.9423097
boxcoxYi <- houstonrealesate$Yi^(-0.9423097)
hist(houstonrealesate$Yi^(-0.9423097))
```

e) Which histogram looks best?
 
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(log(houstonrealesate$Yi), main = "Log transformation")
hist(houstonrealesate$Yi^(-0.9423097), main = "Box Cox")

# The Log transformation shows a more symmetric distribution of the home price variable. 
```

f) Install the library (moment) to calculate the skewness of a histogram. Using this library, calculate the skewness of Yi and the histograms resulting from log and boxcox transformation. Decide which transformation did the best jog of improving the skewness.

```{r}
# install.packages("moments")
library(moments)
skewness(log(houstonrealesate$Yi)) # 1.274064
skewness(houstonrealesate$Yi^(-0.9423097)) # 1.608676

# We can see that the lambda transformation yeilds higher skewness, so this confirms our choice above that the log transformation would be best for our pricing variable. 
```

g) Use the Shapiro test to test for the normality of Yi , logYi, and Yi resulting from boxcox transformation. The null hypothesis is that the histogram of interest is normal vs. the alternative hypothesis that it is not. Use the following command.

```{r}
shapiro.test(houstonrealesate$Yi)
shapiro.test(log(houstonrealesate$Yi))
shapiro.test(houstonrealesate$Yi^(-0.9423097))
```

h) Draw the plot of residuals and qq plot for Y, logYi, and the boxcox transformation of Yi. Compare the plots and decide which transformation did the best job of taking care of the problem and whether any of them solved the problem

# Problem three. 
Using women powers data and codebook posted in the homework folder on week two:

a) Complete the following table

b) Calculate...

b1) t-value for testing the null hypothesis that average income is similar for intact and non-intact families.
b2) Confidence interval for the two-sample test of the mean. Interpret this interval within context.
b3) Sum of square between.
b4) Sum of square within.
b5) F-value for analysis of variance.
b6) Compute and interpret R-squared within context.

# Problem four. 
Using campus climate data, examine the relationship between students’ perception of academic success and class comfort.

a) Recode Q10-A-5 based on the directions given below.

b) Recode the classcomfort based on the directions given below 

c) After recoding, calculate chi-square to examine the relationship between students’ perception of their academic success and their perception of class comfort. Make class comfort row and academic performance column

d) Calculate and interpret row percentage.

e) Calculate the odds ratio of students’ perception of academic success in a comfortable class climate compared to an uncomfortable class climate. Interpret the odds ratio you find within context

# Problem five. 
Suppose you were the TA, Given the following information, how would you explain questions “a”, “b”, and “c” to your students? Hint: See page 92 on the chapter on chi-sqaure F-test in ANOVA.

a) What is the difference between $\alpha_j$ and $\hat \alpha_j$

b) Given the above, explain Why we say that if we fail to reject the null, the expected value of F is one.

c) Given the following output, do the findings represent $E_{MS}(between)$ and $E_{MS}(between)$? Yes or No? Explain your reasoning. 

# Problem six. 
Suppose you were given the following output and plot, how would you explain the findings within context to a non-statistical audience. Make sure you include …

a) The question that we are trying to answer.
b) The significance of findings.
c) Explanation of error bars.
