## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
getwd()

df <- read.csv('standardized_cardata.csv')

```



# Going to do blockwise model regression, from our 3 main groups of variables:
-- Car Description:
- car name (which we will substitute brand_tier in for)
- body of car
- car volume
- curb weight

-- Engine Details:
- Engine Location
- Number of Cylinders
- Fuel Type
- Size of Engine
- Stroke inside engine

-- Car Performance Model:
- peak RPM
- Avg MPG


```{r}
# Car Description Model

m1 <- lm(price ~ brand_tier + carbody + carvolume + curbweight, data = df)
m2 <- lm(price ~ brand_tier + carbody +  curbweight, data = df) # carvolume not significant
summary(m2) 
plot(m2) 
anova(m2, m1) # this shows we are correct to remove carvolume as when we add it, we don't get a significant increase 

```

We're now going to carry m2 into the next segment and add in our next category of variables - engine details.

```{r}
# Car Description Model

m3 <- lm(price ~ brand_tier + carbody +  curbweight + enginelocation + cylindernumber + fueltype + enginesize , data = df)
# now remove variables that weren't significant.. enginetype only has one type that had significance so maybe remove as well
m4 <- lm(price ~ brand_tier + carbody +  curbweight + enginelocation + cylindernumber +  enginesize , data = df)
summary(m4) 
plot(m4) 
anova(m2, m4, m3) # this shows we are correct to remove those variables in m4 because m3 with them included does not improve the fit


```


The only non-significant parameters that remain are certain levels of a categorical variable that does at some level have significance. Will leave them in for now but will look to remove later if necessary.

Will now move forward with m4 and add in our third block of variables which are car performance.



```{r}
# Car Performance Model

m5 <- lm(price ~ brand_tier + carbody +  curbweight + enginelocation + cylindernumber +  enginesize + avg_mpg + peakrpm, data = df)
# avg mpg does not come back as significant so we will remove and retest. Also engine type lost it's significance once other variables were added in so we will remove it
m6 <- lm(price ~ brand_tier + carbody +  curbweight + enginelocation + cylindernumber +  enginesize + peakrpm, data = df)
summary(m6) 
plot(m6) 
anova(m4, m6, m5) # we were correct to remove avg_mpg as it does not improve the fit. peakrpm however does improve the model fit.

# at this point m6 is our final model
```






```{r}
# here's a final model after reviewing industry literature, dividing variables into categories and performing blockwise regression on those categories.

summary(m6)

anova(m6)




```

# Check multicollinearity 
```{r}

AIC(m6) #43.50548
BIC(m6) #103.3197
# R2 adj:  93.41%

vif(m6) #curbweight and engine size > 10 

m7 <- lm(price ~ brand_tier + carbody +  curbweight + enginelocation + cylindernumber + peakrpm, data = df)
summary(m6)
anova(m7,m6) # adding engine size does improve the model but we remove it so we do not have high multicollinearity 

vif(m7) #all less than 5

plot(m7) 

AIC(m7) #59.30549
BIC(m7) #115.7967
# R2 adj:  93.41%
