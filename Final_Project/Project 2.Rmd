## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
# Read in the csv file
hotel <- read.csv("hotel_bookings.csv")
 

# Histgram of the cancelation status
hist(hotel$is_canceled, main = "Histogram of cancelation status")

# Summary of the cancelation status
summary(hotel$is_canceled)

# chi-square between is_canceled and predictors
features <- hotel[c(-1, -2, -6, -10, -14, -19, -24, -25, -29, -30, -31, -32)]
features$arrival_date_year <- factor(features$arrival_date_year)
features
# apply(features, 2, chisq.test, x = hotel$is_canceled)
 
```
